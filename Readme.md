ðŸš¨ NFT metadata is randomly generated using AI and then created as a single emoticon. 
And when multiple people use that emoticon, a certain amount of profit is given to the creator based on the proportional number of uses.

## Project Background

Our project aims to evolve the existing emoji creation and sharing service available on popular messenger platforms like Telegram into a Web3 format. While the current service allows users to create and share emojis, it has limitations in terms of generating revenue or protecting intellectual property (IP) rights for creators. Moreover, there have been constraints for creators to fully unleash their ideas and find inspiration for creative activities.

However, with the advancement of Web3 technology and the emergence of blockchain, new possibilities to overcome these constraints have arisen. We can leverage blockchain technology to tokenize emojis as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and clearly define ownership rights for each emoji. This enables creators to have ownership of their emojis and generate revenue through their usage and sales. Through this approach, creators not only receive protection for their ideas and creations but also gain new opportunities to monetize them.

Furthermore, we can utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to provide creators with new ideas and support for their creative activities. Users can generate metadata for emojis using AI and create their own emojis accordingly. Additionally, an option will be provided to select existing metadata and use AI to generate emojis based on it. This allows creators to produce more diverse and innovative emojis with the assistance of AI, while users have a variety of options to find emojis that suit their preferences.

This project aims to advance the existing emoji creation and sharing service by promoting interaction between creators and users, as well as supporting creative activities. The goal is to assist creators in engaging in continuous creative activities by facilitating a platform where they can monetize their creations and protect their intellectual property rights.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a new platform for emoji creation and sharing. This platform will be implemented in a more advanced Web3 format than existing services, providing creators with more opportunities and offering users a variety of emojis.

## Features

1. NFT-based emoji creation and ownership management.
2. Premium emoji configuration: Users can configure premium emojis, which are sold for tokens rather than being free.
3. Management of emoji and metadata ownership for creators.
4. Emoji metadata generation using AI technology.
5. Emoji download and storage in user wallets.

When premium emojis are sold, creators receive a portion of revenue distributed proportionally based on downloads.

## Project Advantages

1. Provides creators with ownership and revenue opportunities for their creations, supporting creative activities.
2. Meets user demand for a variety of options and emojis by providing diverse choices.
3. Facilitates creators in generating more creative and diverse emojis by utilizing AI.
4. Manages emoji ownership and transactions transparently and securely using blockchain technology.

## Business Model

Our business model revolves around revenue generation from emoji creation and usage. Revenue is appropriately distributed among initial metadata creators, emoji creators, and operators, supporting ongoing platform development and operation.
